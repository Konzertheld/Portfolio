A simple, yet beautiful Habari theme that focuses on making many types of content look good - in a way that can be presented to not only friends and family, but also potential clients and employers.

1.0 supports the following content types:

* entry (Habari's default content type) - shows title and short excerpt for multiple view and full content in single view
* photoset (as in the photoslide plugin) - shows title and random image for multiple view and a nice photoslide in single view
* photo - virtual content type, shows photo for multiple view and photo with title in single view. No known plugins that provide this content type but this form is used by a block this theme provides. It allows you to display random photos from your sets on your front page.

The entire content area can be replaced by blocks. That way you can use plugins to take advantage of the styled content types and at the same time have even more influence on the way your content is displayed. See the features section in the XML for a list of tested suggestions.

Note that it might be necessary to activate some content types in the theme options before anything is displayed.
