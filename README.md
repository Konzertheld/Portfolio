A simple, yet beautiful Habari theme that focuses on making many types of content look good - in a way that can be presented to not only friends and family, but also potential clients and employers.

1.0 supports the following content types:

* entry (Habari's default content type) - shows title and short excerpt for multiple view and full content in single view
* photoset (as in the photoslide plugin) - shows title and random image for multiple view and a nice photoslide in single view
* photo - virtual content type, shows photo for multiple view and photo with title in single view. No known plugins that provide this content type but this form is used by a block this theme provides. It allows you to display random photos from your sets on your front page.
